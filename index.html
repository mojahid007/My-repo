            <p>As soon as you complete your donation, your gift will start its journey. First your money will be turned into food, and then sent to one of the over 80 countries where people are most vulnerable. Every single day, WFP has 5,600 trucks, 30 ships and nearly 100 planes ready to deliver the food you send. Because you can't go there and hand out the food yourself, we do it for you. </p>
